Repo: https://github.com/skywllker/plonky2-examples

+Add files via upload looks unprofessinoal, delete the repo and make the commits via your terminal, +learn how to use git and github.
+Learn cargo commands, cargo init creates a cargo.toml etc
+add cargo.toml, source files should be inside src folder.
+Every example should be runned with command like: cargo run fibonacci
+Your my_fibonacci code are exactly the same as plonky2’s official example, I don’t get the point of adding the official example with my_ prefix to your repo, delete that
+You should change factorial and fibonacci codes as the N would be a public parameter, there is no point of making the same circuit as in the official examples without adding your touches.
+Add sudoku circuit
+Add merkle-inclusion circuit, REF: https://github.com/tornadocash/tornado-core/blob/master/circuits/merkleTree.circom, one element should be represented with 4 Field elements.
pow circuit
Recursive fibonacci circuit
Recursive hashchain
+recursive Merkle tree
